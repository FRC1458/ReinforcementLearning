# Reinforcement Learning

Developing reinforcement learning algorithms for robot navigation
Includes the field and learning setup

Using: OpenAigym:
Main Language: Python:
Section 2 of the main programming team :)

Directions to run it: 
Windows - 
1) Press the "clone or download" button in this repository and copy the https link
2) Open up Git Bash (if you don't have it search up Git bash and download it) and type 'git clone LINK' (paste the link by right clicking and pressing paste)
3) Download Anaconda Python (search it up)
4) Open the anaconda prompt, type cd Reinforcementlearning, then cd model, cd redtiebot, and lastly type ipython setup.py
5) Type ipython q_learning_redtie.py in the anaconda prompt and the program should start running
6) You will see "(Pbd)" appear in the anaconda prompt, type c to continue
7) You will recieve a series of questions, answer them according to how you want the simulation to run (fastmode reduces the amount of print statements, and show graphics shows you every move of the robot in the turtle graphics window)
8) Now the program should run, feel free to edit the code in the q_learning_redtie.py and bot_model.py (ask us before you push)
